            <p>
                My name is Rod Skoglund. I am married and have 4 kids. They all have post-graduate degrees and are actively working. I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree. I have been working in Avionics embedded system development for 30 years. 
            </p>
            <p>        
                I was born in Phoenix, Arizona. I have lived in Delaware, Oregon, Washington and back to Arizona before settling here in Kansas. 
            </p>
            <p>        
                I have co-authored a book on Software Engineering ("Program Smarter, Not Harder: Get Mission-Critical Projects Right the First Time" (ISBN 0-07-021232-5) published by McGraw-Hill, Inc) - I did not choose the title. I also co-authored "Code Reuse in Ada and C++", an article published in May 1993 issue of Embedded Systems Programming.
